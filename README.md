4. **[ProjectTextSuite](https://github.com/Flagro/ProjectTextSuite):** An open-source library designed for QnA LLM pipeline over a projects database folder, supporting multiple file types like word, pdf, pptx, etc with file version control and ability to do automatic question-answering pipelines over large table files like xlsx. Suite consists of the following 6 packages all of which could be used independendly for your purposes (i'm pretty happy with it's modular design):
   - [TextTableScoop](https://github.com/Flagro/TextTableScoop) - file-to-text and table-to-csv parser that safely parses the files with the use of LibreOffice in order to extract text and tables in csv format from the files.
   - [VecMetaQ](https://github.com/Flagro/VecMetaQ) - server wrapper over a FAISS vector database with encapsulated embeddings and metadata storage in order to achieve the fast similarity search and ease of use at the same time.
   - [ProjectTextAgent](https://github.com/Flagro/ProjectTextAgent) - file observer of you project directory as a Docker agent written in Go that updates the database for current state of your files.
   - [xlsx2pandas (PandasXcelerator)](https://github.com/Flagro/xlsx2pandas) - xlsx file parser in order to smartly obtain the data in a flat form in order to import it into a pandas dataframe.
   - [RelaLLM](https://github.com/Flagro/RelaLLM) (Coming soon!) - Multi-Header Dataframe Processing with LLM-Powered Relational Database Mining.
   - [ProjectTextQnA](https://github.com/Flagro/ProjectTextQnA) (Coming soon!) - question-answering interface over your project data in order to perform LLM qa and text-to-sql pipelines. Includes support of both self-hosted LLMs and high quality ones such as OpenAI API.

5. **[My personal blog](https://blog.flagrotown.com) (In progress, coming soon!):** My safe place to post hot takes on modern development, IT trends, entrepreneurship.
   - [FlagroTown Blog Backend](https://github.com/Flagro/flagrotown-blog-backend) - authentication (oauth2), blog management (PostgreSQL, AWS S3) and analytics services implemented in Flask
   - [FlagroTown Blog Frontend](https://github.com/Flagro/flagrotown-blog-frontend) - blog's static frontend written in Svelte with SvelteKit
   - [FlagroTown Blog Repository](https://github.com/Flagro/flagrotown-blog) - new articles are handled by upload to a git repository and blog management is activated via github webhooks. Also this allows me to host my blog simultaneously in two places :)

6. **[SummaryForEveryone](https://github.com/Flagro/SummaryForEveryone) (Currently on pause):** An open-source library for easy and convenient summarization of text, audio, and video using local LLM models.

I am open to collaborations on any of the projects above. Whether you want to contribute to the code, discuss ideas, or offer suggestions, feel free to open an issue or send a pull request!

## üåü About Me
I'm a Data Analyst, LLM Engineer, and Developer specializing in Python and C++. With 3 years of hands-on experience in ML and backend development, I've been contributing to projects supported by brands like Huawei and refined my skills in backend development, focusing on innovative tech solutions. Currently, I'm enhancing the realms of Large Language Models and Natural Language Processing.

Since September 24th 2023, I have embarked on a focused journey towards implementing my vision for open source. Each single day since then is marked with a commitment to contribute, and as of now, I'm proud to maintain a streak of more than three consecutive months of contributions.
